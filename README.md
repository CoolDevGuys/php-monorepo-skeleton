# php-monorepo-skeleton
A php mono repository-multiple application template that (intend to) follow good and clean practices implementing
DDD (Domain Driven Design) using a hexagonal architecture and Symfony 5 as a framework.
The project contain 3 applications (bounded contexts):
- Dashboard backend
- Dashboard frontend
- Store Backend

In this example the Domain is store that handles products, and a dashboard to see some "insights". 

We try to keep the dependencies to the minimum, so the template can be as much reusable as possible
